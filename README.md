# Eco-tower
Here's my project of e-commerce webiste which sells eco-towers for futuristic gardening.

I've created this project beacuse of my portfolio which I'll be posting soon.

I've needed 2 profiles for it, first one was tic tac tie ti show my JS skills and now the second one is this website to show my css skills.

I think it's a good project but it lacks of mediaquerries so it good looking only on your pc, it also does not have a shopping cart due to lack of time to end the project.

I'm pretty sure that I'll be upragding this project in the close future so it'd be perfect to make myself proud and think I could easily use it to my own e-com store or sell it to someone!
